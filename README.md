# Kataster

A minimalist single screen space shooter developed in the Rust language with the Bevy game engine.

This is a 'super-example' or 'micro-game' for the Bevy game engine, that can be used by beginners to get some starting points for their own game.

It includes use of game states, menu UI, HUD UI, collision detection, pause/resume, shader background, particle effects.

It showcases some other commonplace bevy plugins, [avian2d](https://crates.io/crates/avian2d) for physics, [leafwing-input-manager](https://crates.io/crates/leafwing-input-manager) for game inputs, [bevy_hanabi](https://crates.io/crates/bevy_hanabi) for particle effects.
