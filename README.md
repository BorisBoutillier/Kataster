# Kataster
A minimalist single screen space shooter developped in Rust with Bevy and Rapier.

This is a 'super-example' or 'micro-game' for the Bevy engine, that can be used by beginners to get some starting points for their own game.

It includes use of game states, menu UI , HUD UI, collision detection, pause/resume, and a shader background.
